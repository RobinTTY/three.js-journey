# What is WebGL and why use Three.js

Three.js is a **3D JavaScript library** that enables developers to create 3D experiences for the web. It **works with WebGL**, but you can make it work with SVG and CSS as well. Those two are quite limited though.

## Examples of what you can do with Three.js

## What is WebGL?

- JavaScript API
- Renders triangles at a remarkable speed
- Results can be drawn in a `<canvas>`
- Compatible with most modern browsers
- Uses GPU for better performance

### How does WebGL render something?

Imagine that you want to render a 3D model and this model is constituted of 1000 triangles. Each triangle includes 3 points. When we want to render our model, the GPU will have to calculate the position of these 3000 points. Once the model's points are well placed, the GPU needs to draw each visible pixel of those triangles.

The instructions to place the points and draw the pixels are written in what we call **[shaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader)**. We also need to provide data to these shaders. For example: how to place the points according to the model transformations and the camera's properties. These are called **matrices**. We also need to provide data to help colorize the pixels. If there is a light and the triangle is facing that light, it should be brighter than if the triangle isn't.

WebGL benefits from existing at a low level, very close to the GPU. This enables excellent optimizations and more control. The library's goal is to drastically simplify the process of handling all of what we just stated. What would need a lot of code in native WebGL will require dramatically less code in Three.js.
