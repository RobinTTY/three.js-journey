# Lesson 3 - Basic scene

## The Scene

- Like a container
- Inside live things like objects, models, lights, etc.
- At some point we ask Three.js to render that scene

Creating a scene:

```Javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
```

## Objects

Can be many things:

- Primitive geometries
- Imported models
- Particles
- Lights
- etc.

## Meshes

We need to create a type of object named [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh). A Mesh is the combination of a **geometry** (the shape) and a **material** (how it looks).

In the words of the Three.js documentation:

> The Mesh class represents triangular polygon mesh based objects.

## Renderer

- Renders the scene from the camera point of view
- Result drawn into a canvas
- A canvas is a HTML element in which you can draw stuff
- Three.js will use WebGL to draw the render inside this canvas
- You can create the HTML element yourself or let Three.js do it
